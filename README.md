# Note App

This is an advanced note-taking application. It is mostly a frontend application, but I used Supabase for data storage, authentication, and authorization. The reason I didn't use Next.js or Express was to improve my React skills, because I don't think I've ever done such a large project where almost every element depends on each other.
The most difficult part of this project was probably the design. Since there are many things that need to fit on the screen, the layout changes frequently, which often presented me with choices that were not entirely obvious, such as routing setup. There are still a few things I may have missed, so if you spot anything, please let me know !
