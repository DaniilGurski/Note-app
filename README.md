# Note App

This is an advanced note-taking application. It is mostly front-end, but I used Supabase for data storage, authentication, and authorization. I did not use Next.js or Express to instead focus on improving my React skills, as I don't think I've ever done such a large project where almost all UI elements depend on each other.
The most difficult part of creating this application was probably the design. Since there are many elements that need to fit on the screen, the layout changes frequently, which often presented me with choices that were not entirely obvious, such as routing configuration. There are a few more things I may have missed, so if you notice anything, please let me know !
